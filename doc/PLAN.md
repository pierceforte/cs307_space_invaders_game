### NOTE  
After talking to Professor Duvall, we have decided to create a Space Invaders game instead of Breakout.

### Space Invaders Variant  
One interesting variant of Space Invaders that we found is called Chicken Invaders: Revenge of the Yolk.  While the concept behind this game is rather silly and intended to be humorous, we thought that this was a unique way to modify such a well known game and make it truly feel original. There are many different weapon types, the user-controlled spaceship has free range of movement (which is pretty impressive), and there are many different chicken-themed enemies, each of which has its own abilities and adds a significant element to the game. Most remarkably, however, is that the game is multiplayer, and users can play together over the Internet! While our team certainly will not be able to implement that type of functionality, it has inspired us to think beyond the basic concept of Space Invaders.

        - **Shoot both vertical and diagonal lasers**
        
    - Spaceship Specification
        - Will start in the center of the bottom

4. Boss round

    - One big boss in the center
    - Very high health count
    - Shoot in all direction
    - Able to move
    - If time allows:
    	- Boss changes size
        - Has intervals when it is invincible and when it can be damaged
        - Add a boss between each level with increasing level of difficulty

### Enemy Ideas  
- Life count
    - More life counts for upper levels
- Missile type
	- Regular missile (shot downward in regular interval)
    - Diagonal missile (bounce off walls)
- Looks
    - Different images for enemies based on initial health
- Speed 
    - Higher speed for upper levels
- Contains random power up
- Movement
	- left, right, down

### Spaceship
- Life count
- Missile type
- Movement
	- left, right

### Power Up Ideas  
- Bomb Missile 
	- Reduces 2 health counts instead of 1
- Increase life counts
- Speed up the spaceship

  **If time allows**
  - Laser beam
	- Beam from spaceship that instantly hits enemies in path (could last around 1-2 seconds or deactivate after a certain number of enemies are destroyed)
  - Double spaceships
      - Control two spaceships at once 

### Cheat Key Ideas    
- P: pause game
- S: skip level
- D: delete lowest enemy row
- R: reset level
- I: unlimited life counts 
- L: add life
- 1-4+: change to selected level

### Something Extra  
- Adding music
- Final boss between levels (or at the end)
	- Will have a variety of missiles, like a larger missile, one that shoots in multiple directions, etc.
    - If there is a boss between levels, it will become progressively harder with more lives
- We believe these are substantial additions because they will make the game more enjoyable and have more of a video game essence â€“ the games we remember often are memorable due to their sounds, and having a boss will add a challenging element that makes winning more exciting. We also think that adding a boss will be substantial because although it will be flexible to add given our Entity class, it will have many new features that will be challenging to implement.

### Possible Classes  
- Main
	- Begin game
	- Potential methods:
	    - main() method
- Game
	- Handle basic game mechanics like step and animation
	- Potential methods: 
	    - step method to update game continually
- Moving Object
	- Abstract
    - Subclass of ImageView
    - Will be used for any object that is 1) added to the scene and 2) has the potential to move/interact with other nodes on scene
    - Potential methods:
        - update on screen
            - based on position, speed, and elapsed time
        - check for collision and/or out of bounds
- Entity
	- Abstract

- Projectile
	- Abstract
	- Will extend MovingObject
	- Potential methods:
	    - check for collision with wall and bounce off
	    - check for collision with enemy
- Enemy (subclass of Entity)
    - The enemies are the entities that shoot lasers periodically (in a set interval, but beginning at different times to avoid all shooting at once)
    - These will have different amounts of lives and different abilities
    - These will move left to right and bounce of the sides (exact implementation depends on level)
    - Potential methods:
        - change image/make sound when hit
- Spaceship (subclass of Entity)
    - This is the user controlled object that shoots lasers at the enemies
    - Will have a given number of lives to determine game overs
    - Potential methods:
        - wrap around screen
        - react to user input
- Boss (subclass of Entity)
    - This entity will appear at the end of all the levels (or in between levels if time allows)
    - Will have more advanced capabilities than enemies and free range of movement 
    - Potential methods:
        - update interval for when it is invincible/can be hit
- Laser (subclass of projectile)
    - Simple projectile that reduces 1 health
    - Can be fired by any entity
    - Potential methods:
        - set laser image
- Bomb (subclass of projectile)
    - More advanced projectile that reduces 2 health
    - Potential methods:
        - create bomb explosion upon collision
- Level
    - The class that "builds" the level: adds in all scene elements in their proper orientation based on a txt file
    - Keeps track of state of game (eg. lives, points, etc.) and the objects on screen 
    - Potential methods:
        - keep track of lasers/entities on screen and make calls to handle collisions
- Setup
    - Not exactly sure how to implement yet, but may take on some of the work from Level in actually building the scene
    - Potential methods:
        - build the initial scene
- ReadFile
	- Reads input
	- Potential methods:
	    - read in enemy layout file
- UserInput
    - Handles user input for cheat keys and object movement
    - Potential methods:
        - react to each cheat key and update scene accordingly
