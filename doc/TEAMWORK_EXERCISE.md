## Round 1

 * How did it feel to be in a team when one person is more capable than the other?  
Being in a team when one person is more capable than the other is difficult, but it is helpful to understand that everyone has weaknesses and strengths, which was clear during this exersice. We each had the same disadvantage (a less dominant hand) at different points throughout the exercise, so it allowed us to understand each other's weaknesses while using each other's strengths to our advantage.

## Round 2

Notice if you feel resentful, frustrated, proud, confident, etc.

 * How did it feel when you are having an easier time than your partner with the task?  
It was definitely fun to complete the task with more "skill", but, at the same time, we each wanted to make sure that the other person didn't fall too far behind.

 * How did it feel when you are having a harder time than your partner?  
When we were each having a harder time than the other person, it felt comfortable because there was no pressure to "keep up", especially since we were willing to help/motivate each other.

## Round 3

 * Did you ask for help when you need it? Did you offer?   
When one person finished the task first, they offered help to the other person; however, neither of us asked for help during the activity. That said, we do feel that if this were a real assignment, there would be no fear to ask for help and have made that clear to each other.

 * How do you offer help without offending? How do you ask for help without guilt?  
You can offer help without offending by giving tips as opposed to rudely nagging or simply telling someone exactly how to do each step; ie. by giving someone a little advice but not taking over for them. On the other hand, you can ask for help without guilt by being honest about what you don't understand, trying before asking for help, and making it clear that you are willing to offer help as well.

 * What would it feel like if one partner took over and did the entire task, leaving you out?  
It would certainly feel disappointing, and we each agree that we would feel a sense of "missing out" and guilt. 


## Round 4

 * How did you and your partner get better with the task over time? 
Over time, we each got comfortable with our less dominant hands and identified ways to quickly push the candies into groups. Further, we also became more communicative and discussed strategies (like not actually picking up the candy and just sliding it) as well as offering help to each other.
